# javacompetitortest
A small program for accepting java classes, executing them and preforming some measurments.

in IDE just run the JavaCompetitorApplication.java class. After that just go to http://localhost:8080/tasks. For now it works with only one task for triangles. 

Put your solution and press Try button. Your java code will be compiled and executed on-the-fly. After that you'll get a result of the execution. There are a few inputs for testing, so you will see which are passed and which are not. Also if you will write an incorrect java class you'll be notified about the errors you have.
